Question: 11. **Infrastructure and Innovation**: How does technological advancement contribute to solving global challenges, and why is it important to bridge the digital divide?
Answer: Technological advancement contributes to solving global challenges by creating jobs, enhancing energy efficiency, and fostering interconnectedness through the internet. This interconnectedness allows for the sharing of knowledge and resources globally. Bridging the digital divide is crucial because four billion people, primarily in developing countries, lack internet access, limiting their opportunities for growth and innovation. Investing in infrastructure and innovation is essential for sustainable development and ensuring that all individuals can benefit from technological progress.

Question: 12. **Inequality**: What solutions are proposed to reduce income inequality both within and among countries?
